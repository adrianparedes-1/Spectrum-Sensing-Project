# Spectrum-Sensing-Project
This branch contains the transmitter flowchart created with GNU Radio. The flowchart includes a signal source, a noise source, and a selector. The selector GUI allows for live toggling between signal + noise, noise, and signal during live transmission. The flowchart also assumes that you are using a USRP SDR Kit, but it can be substituted with another SDR Kit block. Alternatively, you may eliminate the USRP block for virtual testing.
